pageTitle: Open Compass - Key Indicators for Your Farm.
description: A series of clear and scientific indicators for sustainable agriculture.
---

Objective assessment of agricultural practices is essential to guide our choices. The models used to calculate performance indicators are often complex, and their implementation is not accessible.

The Open Compass project aims to explain and validate the models used to calculate agronomic indicators. It is based on contributions from its community. Anyone can copy and distribute the content of the site, provided the source ([open-compass.org](https://www.open-compass.org)) is credited.
