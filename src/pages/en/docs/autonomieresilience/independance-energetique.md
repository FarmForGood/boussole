## Description

We use this indicator to assess the farm's energy production and consumption. The goal is to be able to give back to society at least as much renewable energy as the renewable and fossil energy used on the farm.

## Unit

Percentage (numerator and denominator in kWh)

## Calculation Method

{% math expression="Energy\\,Independence = \\frac {\\sum_{} Energy\\,Consumption} {\\sum_{} Energy\\,Production}" /%}

## Data Source

The data for both numerator and denominator are provided by the farmer or agronomist. This includes readings from electricity meters, invoices, and accounting records.
