title: Nitrogen Autonomy
description: Nitrogen Autonomy.

## Description

We use this indicator to assess the farm's autonomy in fertilization. It allows us to determine the percentage of nitrogen supplied by the farm or its surroundings. The goal is also to introduce a territorial dimension by promoting cooperation among farms in the same region to create synergy among neighbors.

## Unit

Kilos of Nitrogen per hectare

## How Is It Calculated?

It is the percentage of the amount of nitrogen fixed by the system through legumes, recycled by vegetative cover, and provided by local organic fertilization (with a decreasing scale depending on the supply distance), relative to the total amount of nitrogen supplied to the plant:

Decreasing scale:

- 1 to 20km = local
- 21 to 120km = gradual decrease of 1% per kilometer

The calculation involves dividing the local nitrogen quantity (fertilization provided by cover crops and legumes, and organic fertilization multiplied by the scale coefficient) by the total nitrogen quantity (fertilization provided by cover crops and legumes, organic fertilization, and mineral fertilization).

## Data Source

The data is provided by the farmer and encoded by the agronomist.

## {% compass quarter="nw" inline="true" /%} In the Compass

- Min: 0% for a farm that relies solely on distant exogenous fertilization
- Max: 100% completely autonomous with cover crops, legumes, and interactions with livestock for local fertilization.
